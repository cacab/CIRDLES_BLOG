This post discusses the debugging of SQUID Web, running locally. 

In Chrome, upon attempting to upload Prawn and Task files, the following error is generated: 

Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://cirdles.cs.cofc.edu/Services/squidReporting' from origin 'http://localhost:8080' has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.

The following items fix this error: 

In /usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf, change the port from 80 to 8080. 

In Squid/index.js, change the endpoint to https://cirdles.cs.cofc.edu/Services/squidReporting. 

In Chrome, download the Moesif CORS extension, and make sure it is switched "ON".
